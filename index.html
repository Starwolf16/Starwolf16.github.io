  <h2 id="head">Internet Censorship in North Korea</h2>
  <p id="intro">
    Internet Censorship is when a company or a country blocks
    certain sites, and also patrols who accesses the internet and what<br>
    they do.  This is not a good thing for a government to do because
    it violates peoples freedom.  However, this allows a government to<br>
    monitor what people are doing.  This ability allows the goverment to
    protect the safety of those within it's borders, as it is able to <br>
    identify potential threats to the country and the public.  Censorship
    in a mild form isn't bad, but once its take to the extreme that the <br>
    Communist nations of today have, then it is a violation of human rights.

        In North Korea, the government controls what people see and do. They are
          able to control what their people see and what they do on the internet.
          Also, the people of North Korea have no access to computers except for a
          select few: elites, state hackers, and select university students.  When
          North Korea installed a closed cell network, the people began to smuggle in
          illegal Chinese cellphones, and using the Chinese network, which can be accessed
          within a few  miles of the border.  Most of the internet blockage is done through
          a 'mosquito net'.  This mosquito net only allows the bare minimun of the internet
          in, so that the country is able to survive.

        Since the internet is a global databse, the people of North Korea could use the internet to see
          what the world outside the borders of their country is like.  If they saw this, the Korean governent
          fears that they would rebel.  So They used a closed network, synomimous to a large business network
          here in America.  This closed network allows the government to monitor and control internet access.
          In order for the Koreans to limit the access that the population has to the internet, the government
          has set up the closed network, called the Kwangmyong.  There are a limited number of news sites,
          chat rooms, and message boards available to the population.
      </td>
      <td>
        In North Korea, only the elites and select university students are able to access the World Wide Web,
          and only under heavy surveilance.  Because not many people have a PC, there aren't many people that
          are able to access the Intranet, the Kwangmyong, either.  This intranet isn't much help either, as
          the regime also heavily censors it, to keep the people from spreading ideas that could bring down
          the Communist regime.  In an attempt to advance a little, Kim Jong-un brought in an Egyptian Cell
          Service company to help set up a closed 3G network within the borders of his country.  This network
          is almost as censored as the Kwangmyong.

      The Second Great Awakening is when the Protestant Religion is going through
      a revival.  This movement is mostly led by Baptist and Methodist leaders and 
      is a reaction against skepticism, deism, and Rational Chrisitanity.  
      The Second Great Awakening, believes in Arminian Theology, which states
      that every person can be saved through revivals, repentance, and conversion.

            Charles Gandison Finney converted to Christianity in 1821, and since
            then, he has been one of our most prominent speakers in the Northern
            States.  He is constantly filling the largest speech halls available,
            and conducting powerful revival meetings all over the eastern cities.  His
            revival meeting in Rochester, New York caused 1500 more revivals in
            towns and villages.

            Lyman Beecher is one of the preachers of our movement.  He started off
            preaching at a Presbyterian Church, but eventually moved to a Calvinistic Church.
            When he was called to the Hanover Church of Boston, he started preaching against
            unitarianism, which was sweeping the area.  He went on to teach at the
            Lane Seminary in Concinnati.  There, he taught many ministers to win the
            West for Protestantism.

            Barton W. Stone is an important Minister in the Second Great Awakening,
            and he helped to lead the cane Ridge Revival, which was a several day 
            communion season attened by 20,000 people.  When he disagreed with the 
            Kentucky synod, he and 4 other ministers created the Springfield Presbytry, 
            which attracted 15 congregations in Ohio and Kentucky.

            Peter Cartwright is a Methodist Revivalist who helped start the Second
            Great Awakening.  He has personally baptized 12,000 converts.  Since he
            is opposed to slavery, he moved from Kentucky to Illinois, and was
            elected to the lower house of the Illinois Great Assembly in 1828 and
            1832.  When he was a Methodist Circuit rider, he rode the circuits in
            Kentucky and Illinois, as well as Tennessee, Indiana, and Ohio.

      Most of the social reform of the Antebellum era came out of the new devotion
      religion, and the efforts to apply Christian Teaching to the resolution of
      social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19<sup><u>th</u></sup>
      Century.  
    <h2>
      Synthesis:
    </h2 align="center">
    This event is comparable to the First Great Awakening because they were both 
    religious movements, both in the Protestant religion, and had speakers that 
    were able to attract large crowds.
