      The Second Great Awakening is when the Protestant Religion is going through
      a revial.  We are led by Baptist and Methodist leaders, for the most part,
      and is a reaction to skepticism, deism, and Rational Chrisitanity.  The
      In the Second Great awakening, we believe in Arminian Theology, which says
      that every person can be saved through revivals, repentance, and conversion.<table align="center">

            then, he has been one of our most prominent speakers in the Northern

            and conducts powerful revival meetings all over the easter cities.  His

            Lyman Beecher is one of the preachers of our movement.  He started off
            preaching at a Presbyterian Church, but eventually moved to Calvinism.
            When he was called to the Hanover Church of Boston, he preached against
            unitarianism, which was sweeping the area.  He went on to teach at the
            Lane Seminary in Concinnati.  There, he taught many ministers to win the
            West for Protestantism.

            lead the cane Ridge Revival, which was a several day communion season
            attened by 20,000 people.  When he disagreed with the Kentucky synod,
            he and 4 other ministers created the Springfield Presbytry, which

            Great Awakening.  He personally baptised 12000 converts.  Since he
            was opposed to slavery, he moved from Kentucky to Illinois, and was
            elected to the lower house of the Illinois Great Assembly in 1828 and
            1832.  When he was a Methodist Circuit rider, he rode the circuits in
            Kentucky and Illinois, as well as Tennessee, Indiana, and Ohio.

      Most of the social reform of the Antebellum era came out of the new devotion
      religion, and the efforts to apply Christian Teaching to the resolution of
      social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19<sup><u>th</u></sup>
      Century.

        Synthesis
      </h2>
      During the Second Great Awakening, people were focused on religion, and
      what it could do for them.  For example, there were many converts to both
      the Methodist and Baptist denominations of Christianity.  Much of the same
      happened during the First Great Awakening.  Also, the Second Great Awakening
      was a rebuttal against the rising Skeptism, Deism, and Rational Chrisitanty.
      These ideas are echoed during the Age of Enlightenment.  During the time
      of the Age of Enlightenment, the First Great Awakening was happening, and
      one can assume that the First Great Awakening, while not a specific reaction
      to the ideals of enlightenment, was against it.  The people that were mentioned
      above were able to attract large crowds when they spoke.  For example, Barton
      Stone was able to attract twenty thousand people to one of his sessions, which
      was over a few days.  One of the leaders of the First Great Awakening, George
      Whitefield, as also able to attract large and emotional crowds to his
      itinerant sermons.
