      The Second Great Awakening is when the Protestant Religion is going through
      a revial.  We are led by Baptist and Methodist leaders, for the most part,
      and is a reaction to skepticism, deism, and Rational Chrisitanity.  The
      In the Second Great awakening, we believe in Arminian Theology, which says
      that every person can be saved through revivals, repentance, and conversion.<table align="center">

            Charles Gandison Finney converted to Christianity in 1821, and since
            then, he has been one of our most prominent speakers in the Northern
            States.  He is constantly filling the largest speech halls available,
            and conducting powerful revival meetings all over the eastern cities.  His
            revival meeting in Rochester, New York caused 1500 more revivals in
            towns and villages.

            Lyman Beecher is one of the preachers of our movement.  He started off
            preaching at a Presbyterian Church, but eventually moved to a Calvinistic Church.
            When he was called to the Hanover Church of Boston, he started preaching against
            unitarianism, which was sweeping the area.  He went on to teach at the
            Lane Seminary in Concinnati.  There, he taught many ministers to win the
            West for Protestantism.

            Kentucky synod, he and 4 other ministers created the Springfield Presbytry, 
            which attracted 15 congregations in Ohio and Kentucky.

            elected to the lower house of the Illinois Great Assembly in 1828 and
            1832.  When he was a Methodist Circuit rider, he rode the circuits in

      Most of the social reform of the Antebellum era came out of the new devotion
      religion, and the efforts to apply Christian Teaching to the resolution of
      social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19<sup><u>th</u></sup>
      Century.
