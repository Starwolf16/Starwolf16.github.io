  <h2 id="head">Internet Censorship in North Korea</h2>
  <p id="intro">
    Internet Censorship is when a company or a country blocks
    certain sites, and also patrols who accesses the internet and what<br>
    they do.  This is not a good thing for a government to do because
    it violates peoples freedom.  However, this allows a government to<br>
    monitor what people are doing.  This ability allows the goverment to
    protect the safety of those within it's borders, as it is able to <br>
    identify potential threats to the country and the public.  Censorship
    in a mild form isn't bad, but once its take to the extreme that the <br>
    Communist nations of today have, then it is a violation of human rights.

        In North Korea, the government controls what people see and do. They are
          able to control what their people see and what they do on the internet.
          Also, the people of North Korea have no access to computers except for a
          select few: elites, state hackers, and select university students.  When
          North Korea installed a closed cell network, the people began to smuggle in
          illegal Chinese cellphones, and using the Chinese network, which can be accessed
          within a few  miles of the border.  Most of the internet blockage is done through
          a 'mosquito net'.  This mosquito net only allows the bare minimun of the internet
          in, so that the country is able to survive.

        Since the internet is a global databse, the people of North Korea could use the internet to see
          what the world outside the borders of their country is like.  If they saw this, the Korean governent
          fears that they would rebel.  So They used a closed network, synomimous to a large business network
          here in America.  This closed network allows the government to monitor and control internet access.
          In order for the Koreans to limit the access that the population has to the internet, the government
          has set up the closed network, called the Kwangmyong.  There are a limited number of news sites,
          chat rooms, and message boards available to the population.

        In North Korea, only the elites and select university students are able to access the World Wide Web,
          and only under heavy surveilance.  Because not many people have a PC, there aren't many people that
          are able to access the Intranet, the Kwangmyong, either.  This intranet isn't much help either, as
          the regime also heavily censors it, to keep the people from spreading ideas that could bring down
          the Communist regime.  In an attempt to advance a little, Kim Jong-un brought in an Egyptian Cell
          Service company to help set up a closed 3G network within the borders of his country.  This network
          is almost as censored as the Kwangmyong.
